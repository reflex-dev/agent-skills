# Agents

This project uses the **Reflex agent skills** — up-to-date knowledge for building full-stack Python web apps with [Reflex](https://reflex.dev). Install them first, then use them as described below.

## Installing the Skills

Before working on this project, make sure the Reflex skills are available to you.

### Claude Code

Install via the plugin marketplace (run these in the Claude Code prompt):

```
/plugin marketplace add reflex-dev/agent-skills
/plugin install reflex@reflex-agent-skills
```

Once installed, the skills auto-load based on the conversation — you don't need to read them manually.

### Other agents (Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, Pi)

```
npx skills add reflex-dev/agent-skills
```

Or clone https://github.com/reflex-dev/agent-skills and copy the `skills/` folders into your agent's skill directory (see the repo README for paths).

### Verifying

After installing, confirm these three skills are available before continuing: `reflex-docs`, `setup-python-env`, and `reflex-process-management`. If they are not, repeat the install step above.

## Using the Skills

### Reflex documentation

For anything about Reflex APIs — components, state management, events, styling, database, routing, authentication — use the **reflex-docs** skill rather than relying on memory. It carries current, version-accurate docs.

### Initializing a new Reflex project

When starting a new Reflex project or setting up a development environment, you **must** follow the **setup-python-env** skill before doing anything else.

Do not skip any steps. Do not assume a virtual environment or Reflex is already available — always verify first by following the skill's instructions in order.

After the environment is ready and Reflex is installed, run:

```bash
reflex init
```

Then proceed with the user's request.

### Managing a Reflex process

When you need to compile, run, reload, or debug a Reflex application, follow the **reflex-process-management** skill for the correct sequence and error investigation steps.
